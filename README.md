# 📚 CollabEase –  Learning and Management App

## 🌟 Project Vision
**CollabEase** is a mobile platform designed to bridge the communication gap between **learners** and **educators**. Our vision is to create a unified space where both roles can interact effortlessly — sharing announcements, creating and managing tasks, tracking performance, and staying connected through an intuitive and responsive interface.  

We aim to empower learners with clear visibility of their educational journey, while giving educators the tools to manage, track, and inspire student success effectively.
